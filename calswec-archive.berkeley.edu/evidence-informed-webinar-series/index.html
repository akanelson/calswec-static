<p><strong>CalYOUTH: Early Findings from the Youth Survey, Child Welfare Worker Survey, and Administrative Data Analyses<br />
<em>Date:&nbsp;</em></strong>September 22, 2015<br />
<strong><em>Presenter:&nbsp;</em></strong>Nathanael Okpych, <em>M.S.W., M.A., CalYOUTH Project Director<a href="https://vimeo.com/140361040" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="../sites/default/files/uploads/calyouth_0/index.html" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; float:right; height:198px; margin:5px; width:280px" title="Click opening slide of CalYOUTH: Early Findings from the Youth Survey, Child Welfare Worker Survey, and Administrative Data Analyses to hear archived recording" /></a><br />
<strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;</em>This webinar will incorporate key findings from existing data that have been collected by the CalYOUTH Study. Findings from the baseline youth survey and the first caseworker survey will cover topics such as youth outcomes in a number of domains (e.g., education, relationships and social support, mental health), the need for transitional living services in a number of domains, and attitudes toward extended care. Preliminary findings from&nbsp;administrative data analyses will examine if and how extended foster care has affected youths’ permanency outcomes by age 18 and rates of postsecondary enrollment by age 19.5. More information about the CalYOUTH study and written reports can be found at: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.chapinhall.org/research/report/findings-california-youth-transitions-adulthood-study-calyouth">http://www.chapinhall.org/research/report/findings-california-youth-transitions-adulthood-study-</a><a href="http://www.chapinhall.org/research/report/findings-california-youth-transitions-adulthood-study-calyouth">calyouth</a></p>

<strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong></em>This webinar presents information obtained from&nbsp;public child welfare workers who self-selected to participate in a&nbsp;worker health survey examining the associations between&nbsp;secondary traumatic stress, individual and work&nbsp;factors, and&nbsp;general health outcomes. These public child welfare workers&nbsp;were surveyed during professional development training classes&nbsp;that took place in Northern California. Findings revealed &nbsp;that&nbsp;public child welfare workers experiencing higher levels of&nbsp;secondary traumatic symptoms is related to poorer health&nbsp;outcomes and having an increased desire to leave their current place of work. Stemming from these findings the NCTA is developing resources to deliver online training curricula and peer support in an effort to improve the physical and emotional health of public child welfare workers.</p>

<em><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong></em>Children entering families through adoption and guardianship bring with them a history of grief, loss, and often trauma. This is especially true of children formerly in foster care. Recently, increasing attention is being paid to the special needs of these families and, in particular, how mental health and other support services tailored to adoptive families can effectively help children heal and achieve success at home, at school, and in the community.</p>

<p>This webinar will focus on the history and research that have led to a more enlightened understanding of the clinical needs of adoption and guardianship families—why this is such a complex issue and what is being done to improve clinical and other support services. In addition, it will discuss training and practice models that are being developed or currently used to address the need for adoption-competent clinical services. Finally, the webinar will include a personal testimonial from one adoptive family who struggled to get access to appropriate services, as well as an overview of the AB1790 legislation that is propelling this issue forward in California.</p>

<em><strong>Presenter:</strong></em> Pajarita Charles, Ph.D., CalYOUTH Project Director, School of Social Service Administration, University of Chicago<br />
<em><strong>Description:</strong></em> The California Youth Transitions to Adulthood Study (CalYOUTH) is an evaluation of the impact of AB 12, the California Fostering Connections to Success Act, on outcomes during the transition to adulthood for foster youth. The study includes a collection of information from transition-age youth and child welfare workers, as well as analysis of government program data. The study, directed by Dr. Mark Courtney from the University of Chicago and conducted in collaboration with the California Department of Social Services and County Welfare Directors Association, is being carried out over a 5-year period and is following youth ages 16-17 through age 21 using in-person interviews to complete three waves of surveys. To date, both a baseline child welfare worker survey and youth survey have been completed, in addition to qualitative interviews and observations of young people's living arrangements in foster care.</p>

<em><strong>Date:</strong>&nbsp;</em>September 18, 2014<br />
<em><strong>Presenters:&nbsp;</strong></em>Oronde A. Miller, Senior Associate, Center for the Study of Social Policy, and Erwin McEwen, Senior Director, Technical Assistance Unit, Casey Family Programs<br />
<em><strong>Description: </strong></em>A growing number of child welfare agencies and organizations are working to understand and undo the pattern of racial disproportionality and disparate outcomes among children and families involved with this nation’s child welfare systems. Less attention, however, has been given to the particular experiences of African American boys and young men.</p>

<p>This webinar will review what is known about the experiences of African American males involved with child welfare and the key elements of organizational and system improvement strategies aimed at improving their experiences and outcomes. System improvement strategies include those that are evidence-informed, with a focus on family-centered, trauma-informed, and strengths-based interventions with youth and their families, as well as organizational operation approaches that are culturally responsive and that respond to the experiences of race and racism in the lives of African American males and their families.</p>

<p><strong>Child Welfare Partnership for Research and Training&nbsp;</strong><br />
<em><strong>Date: </strong></em>July 24, 2014&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong>Presenters: </strong></em>Laurie Drabble, Ph.D., Professor,San José State University School of Social Work, and Director,&nbsp;SJSU Institute for Community Partnered Research (ICPR); Barbara Watkins, M.S.W., Santa Clara County Social Services Agency; Darlene Da Silva, M.S.W.<br />
<em><strong>Description:</strong> </em>The Child Welfare Partnership for Research and Training (CW-PART) is a collaborative project of the SJSU&nbsp;School of Social Work and two counties, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz.&nbsp;The model provides a situated learning environment for IV-E and other interested students where teams conduct applied research on issues of immediate relevance to the county or partnered agencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This workshop describes core elements of the partnered research model, roles of different stakeholders, and "lessons learned" for adaptation to other county and university contexts.&nbsp;Findings from qualitative interviews and stakeholder surveys suggest that county partners perceive the partnership as valuable and that students in partnered research teams are more likely than other students to report researching a problem or issue that is&nbsp;directly relevant to the agency interested in being a part of research and evaluation in the future.&nbsp;The structure and impact of the partnered models will be illustrated through highlights from: a trauma-informed systems change initiative outcomes and processes in differential response services.</p>

<p><strong>A Strengths-based Approach to Supervised Visitation in Child Welfare&nbsp;</strong><br />
<em><strong>Date: </strong></em>July 15, 2014<br />
<em><strong>Presenters: </strong></em>&nbsp;Valerie Shapiro, Ph.D., Assistant Professor,&nbsp;School of Social Welfare, University of California, Berkeley, and Heidi Sims, Administrator of Family Preservation Department of SCAN (Stop Child Abuse &amp; Neglect),&nbsp;Fort Wayne, Indiana<br />
<em><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong></em>Supervised visitation gives parents accused of abuse or neglect the opportunity to spend time with children temporarily removed from their care. Although supervised visitation has the potential to be a tool for promoting successful reunification by maintaining or growing caregiver relationships with children, and pursuing and monitoring caregiver skill acquisition, the risk-management objective that underlies child protection services creates a challenging context for strengths-based approaches.</p>

<p>This presentation will describe a strengths-based approach to supervised visitation within the child welfare system.&nbsp;It articulates a practice model that navigates the tension between the dual aims of child welfare services: risk management and fostering change that leads to a successful reunification. This model&nbsp;embraces resilience theory, grounded in strengths-based strategies to build protective factors.</p>

<p>Moreover, this presentation describes the collaborative construction of the Joan Sherman Program for Resilient Children through the integration of insights from diverse stakeholders, research evidence, and strengths-based practice principles. Five aspects of the model will be described in depth: enhancing the visitation environment, strengths-based assessment, stable visitation routines, activities to promote resilience, and progress check-ups. The presentation will also describe the training program developed to build workforce capacity and support model implementation. It will conclude by reflecting upon the successes of, and challenges to, the implementation of a strengths-based approach to supervised visitation.</p>

<p><strong>Child Welfare Workers' Views on Physical Punishment of Children<br />
<em>Date:</em></strong>&nbsp;May 8, 2014<br />
<strong><em>Presenters:&nbsp;</em></strong>Elizabeth Breshears, Ph.D., Associatie Professor, CSU Stanislaus, and Leisa Baltz, 2nd year M.S.W. student, CSU Stanislaus<br />
<em><strong>Description: </strong></em>The opinions of U.S. child welfare workers—which appear to parallel the general public’s belief—that physical punishment is sometimes “necessary” pose a challenge to child welfare agencies in addressing best practices in parenting. Research conducted over the last 60 years provides a robust body of evidence that physical punishment of children is antithetical to best child rearing practices and is a high-risk parenting strategy. The only U.S. group for whom physical punishment remains legal is children. Perhaps it is time for child welfare agencies to facilitate a cultural shift in how we nurture and parent children. This webinar will compare policies on physical punishment of children in the U.S. and other developed countries, examine the knowledge and opinions of Central Valley child welfare workers on this issue, and review the NASW’s policy position.</p>

<p><strong>The Real Meaning of Fidelity in Implementation Science<br />
<em>Date:</em></strong>&nbsp;January 23, 2014<br />
<em><strong>Presenters:</strong></em>&nbsp;Dean Fixsen, Ph.D., &nbsp;and Sonja Schoenwald, Ph.D.<br />
<em><strong>Desription:</strong></em>&nbsp;There is an increased focus on comparative effectiveness, accountability for outcomes, and consumer choice across public service sectors at the federal level, and in many states. At the same time, treatments and services with demonstrated effectiveness are increasingly becoming available in a variety of practice contexts.&nbsp;In this context, it is increasingly important to be able to answer the question&nbsp;"When we ask and pay for a service, how do we know that we are getting what we asked and paid for?"</p>

<p>Fidelity is one indicator that a particular treatment or service is being implemented as intended with the particular populations that the treatment or service has been shown to benefit. Tools to measure fidelity can be used to improve implementation and outcomes. This webinar will focus on what<em> fidelity </em>means, what research tells us about why and how it matters, and what we know and have yet to learn about tools to measure and support it in community practice contexts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>California's Most Vulnerable Parents: A Population-Based Examination of Youth Involved with Child Protective Services<br />
<em>Date</em></strong><em>:</em>&nbsp;January 9, 2014&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong>Presenters:&nbsp;</strong></em>Emily Putnam-Hornstein, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, USC School of Social Work, Principal Investigator at the Children's Data Network and Researcher at the CA Child Welfare Indicators Project, and Bryn King, Doctoral Candidate,&nbsp;UC Berkeley, School of Social Welfare, and Graduate Student Researcher,&nbsp;CA Child Welfare Indicators Project&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong></em>This webinar will describe and discuss findings to emerge from the recently released study on&nbsp;"California's Most Vulnerable Parents:&nbsp;A Population-Based Examination of Youth Involved with Children Protective Services." This research was funded by the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation and conducted by researchers at USC and UC Berkeley in collaboration with the California Department of Social Services.</p>

<p>The project involved the linkage of roughly 1.4 million California birth records with 1 million child protection records to characterize the teen birth rates of adolescent girls with a history of maltreatment. Additional linkages allowed for the examination of maltreatment outcomes among children born to teen mothers. These new data document that 1 in 4 teens in foster care give birth before age 20 and as many as 40%&nbsp;of these young mothers have a second child during their teens. In the population overall, 4 in 10 teen mothers have been reported as alleged victims of abuse or neglect before pregnancy and 20%&nbsp;have a history of substantiated maltreatment. Children born to teens with a history of maltreatment victimization are abused and neglected at twice the rate of children whose teen mothers had no CPS involvement.</p>

<p><strong>Communities of Practice and Motivational Interviewing<br />
Date:&nbsp;</strong>April 24, 2013&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong>Presenter:&nbsp;</strong></em>Melinda Hohman, Ph.D., Professor, San Diego State University&nbsp;School of Social Work&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</em>Implementation of Evidence-Based Practices remains a large issue within social services. Research has shown that skills are lost or not used at all after training. This webinar will review the research about implementation science with a particular focus on developing resources for coaching and feedback, either within an agency setting or as a self-run group composed of voluntary practitioners from the community. The use of Communities of Practice for Motivational Interviewing (MI) will be the specific example throughout this presentation.</p>

<p><strong>How the Perspective of Fathers Contributes to Disproportionality: A Real Discussion</strong><br />
<strong><em>Date:</em></strong>&nbsp;April 22, 2013<br />
<em><strong>Presenters: </strong></em>Kilolo Brodie, Ph.D., CSU Stanislaus, and Natasha Paddock, Regional Director, Region C, NASW&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em>Description:</em>&nbsp;</strong>A visible pattern in child welfare is the diminished role of fathers and marginalization of their importance. The purpose of this study was to exam barriers to father involvement, including institutional obstacles and gender bias (as the majority of child welfare workers are female). To obtain the perspective of fathers, researchers collected quantitative and qualitative data from men in a mandated parenting class in the Bay Area. All of the participants were men of color. Responses indicated that the majority did not feel they were treated the same as the mother of their children.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Mental Health Services and Psychiatric Medications in Juvenile Detention Facilities and the Impact of State Placement Policy&nbsp;</strong><br />
<strong><em>Date:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em>January 23, 2012&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em>Presenter</em></strong> Edward Cohen, Ph.D., Associate Professor, San José State University&nbsp;School of Social Work&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong>Description: </strong></em>The use of psychotropic medications is a significant factor in the overall effort to respond to detained youth with mental illness, who are over-represented in juvenile detention facilities. This presentation reports on the proportion of these youth who receive mental health services and psychotropic medications in California. Also covered is the impact on these proportions of the state’s juvenile justice realignment—the&nbsp;transfer of non-violent juvenile offenders from state placements to counties. Findings from a recent survey of counties will also be used to provide the context for the impact of this policy decision on county agencies.</p>

<p><strong>Race, Poverty, and Nativity: An Examination of Risk and Protective Factors for Child Welfare Involvement<br />
<em>Date:</em></strong>&nbsp;June 11, 2012&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em>Presenters:</em></strong> Barbara Needell, Ph.D.,&nbsp;M.S.W., and Emily Putnam-Hornstein, Ph.D.,&nbsp;M.S.W.,&nbsp;Center for&nbsp;Social Services Research (CSSR)&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em>Description:</em></strong>&nbsp;Race and ethnicity are widely viewed as markers for a complex interaction of economic, social, political, and environmental factors that influence the health of individuals and communities. This webinar explored differences in children’s risk of maltreatment by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic indicators, and maternal nativity. Racial disparities were examined in the areas of referrals received by CPS, substantiation rates, and entries to foster care. Participants learned about the newly developed racial disparity indices that incorporate race-specific poverty rates.</p>
